title: "Manage your data as you go"
---

While actively working on your projects, there are several practices that can help you to manage your data in an efficient manner that will help you to collaborate with others (including your futureself!) and make your work more reproducible.


## Track your data sources

As you collect your data, if using pre-existing data sources, we strongly recommend that you keep track of where/by whom you accessed the data you will use.  It can be a link to a data archive, an official agency website, or the contact information of a person. This data log can be developed using a spreadsheet that you can share with your team. The goal here is to make sure you can:

- Go back to the original source and the right version of the data
- Correctly attribute/cite the data sources when you project
- Reach out to data creators and ask for potential clarifications you might need to correctly interpret the data
- Inquiry for any data updates at a later date


## Keep raw data raw

During the data collection phase, also make sure to create a dedicated folder(s) to save the raw data version you just acquired. 

If you are using a programmatic approach to acquire your data (e.g., API), make sure to only read the raw data and save any processed intermediate data products in a different folder. We recommend changing the permissions on your raw data folder to read-only to avoid any unexpected incidents.

If you are accessing the data using a Graphical User Interface (GUI), we recommend you create a "working copy" of your raw data in a separate folder and use those files as it is often very easy to accidentally overwrite it.  


## Project organization

We generally recommend encapsulating your project into few folders. It will make it more portable when combined with a [relative path](https://www.educative.io/answers/absolute-vs-relative-path) and help you keep the information centralized in one place. Here is a potential starting point for your file structure with three subfolders:

- Data: where you will store your data with the following file structure
    - Input_data: to store the raw data you collected or/and are reusing
    - Intermediate_data: to store any cleaned or merged data sets
    - Analysis_data: any model analytical outputs that you computed
- Code or Scripts: you can store your scripts in this folder. You can keep everything within the folder using filename to organize it or create subfolders as needed
- Results: to store tables, graphs, reports, or any other scientific products you are producing

In the top-level folder, we also recommend you write a README to explain your project, list the contributors and provide information on how to best navigate your project folder as well as a short description of the files it contains.

 **Think of what README template could be developed for your research lab to help with standardizing this information across projects.**


## Adopt a consistent naming convention

Develop naming conventions for files and folders:

- Avoid spaces (use underscores or dashes)
- Avoid punctuation or special characters
- Try to leverage alphabetical order (e.g., start with dates: 2020-05-08)
- Use descriptive naming (lite metadata)
- Use folders to structure/organize content
- Keep it simple
- Make it programmatically useful:
    - Useful to select files (Wildcard *, regular expression)
    - But donâ€™t forget Humans need to read file names too!!
    - Tip: leverage the use of `_` and `-` to make your filename readable by both Humans and machines!

#### Try it:

Which filename would be the most useful?

- `06-2020-08-sensor2-plot1.csv`
- `2020-05-08_light-sensor-1_plot-1.csv`
- `Measurement 1.csv`
- `2020-05-08-light-sensor-1-plot-2.csv`
- `2020-05-08-windSensor1-plot3.csv`

***Remember, the most important is to make it consistent!***

## Backup your data

Don't forget, things happen!!!
