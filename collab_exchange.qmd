title: "Code ~~Review~~ Exchange"
---

Code Exchange is an asynchronous activity that takes place when a teammate is finished working on an script (or a part of). This teammate will submit a request to another team member to look over the code and provide feedback. It is a great way to:

- Have one more pair of eyes looking at your code to detect potential bugs / improvements, including analytical aspects of the code 
- Motivate development of good documentation
- Generate conversation about code styling
- Have several team members sharing knowledge
- Great way to onboard new team members both in terms of code knowledge but also code styling

The Reviewer should see this activity as a great way to learn from others through **constructive** feedback... and so should the Submitter!!
