title: "Code ~~Review~~ Exchange"
---

Code Exchange is an asynchronous activity that is a great way to:

- Have one more pair of eyes looking at your code to detect potential bugs / improvements
- Motivate development of good documentation
- Generate conversation about code styling
- Have several team members sharing knowledge
- Great way to onboard new team members both in terms of code knowledge but also code styling

The Reviewer should see this activity as a great way to learn from others through **constructive** feedback... and so should the Submitter!!
