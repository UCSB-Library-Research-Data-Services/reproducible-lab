title: "Code ~~Review~~ Exchange"
---

Code Exchange is an asynchronous activity that takes place when a teammate is finished working on a script (or a section of it). This teammate will submit a request to another team member to look over the code and provide feedback. It is a great way to:

- Have one more pair of eyes looking at your code to detect potential bugs / improvements, including analytical aspects of the code 
- Motivate development of good documentation
- Generate conversation about code styling
- Have several team members sharing knowledge
- Great way to onboard new team members both in terms of code knowledge but also code styling

The Reviewer should see this activity as a great way to learn from others through **constructive** feedback... and so should the Submitter!! 

There are different way to conduct a code review. It ranges from asking a colleague to look at your code once you reached a milestone, for example a new analysis is working, to leveraging Pull Request (PR), which is a way to ask to merge your changes with the previous version. 


## Pull Request (PR)

A big advantage of Pull Request is to document and provide a space to discuss the new code and discuss potential modifications. You can even tag others if you want them to chime in.

To be able to create a PR, you need to first either create a branch or a fork, which are two ways to encapsulate your changes while you are working on them. Once you are done you can ask to send back and merge those changes to the current version of the main branch of the repository (for now we will only merge back to main).
