## FAIR pinciples

**we recommend using the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) & [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) principles as guidance** to maximize the reusability of your data by you, your collaborators, other researchers, and future-you.  Your plan should ensure that detailed documentation adopting existing standards is developed during the entire duration of your project (don't wait until the very end!!) and that this documentation is archived along with your data and code in a publicly accessible data repository will set you up for success.

a. No

b. Yes


#### 3. How is the data described with metadata?

a. The data are not described

b. Brief title and description

c. Comprehensive, but in a text-based, non-standard format

a. The data are not described in any repository

b. Local institutional repository

c. Domain-specific repository

d. Generalist public repository

e. Data are in one place but discoverable through several registries



### **A**ccessible


#### 5. How accessible is the data

a. No access to data or metadata

b. Access to metadata only

c. Unspecified conditional access, e.g. contact the data custodian

d. Embargoed access after a specified date

e. A de-identified / modified subset of the data is publicly accessible

f. Fully accessible to persons who meet explicitly stated conditions, e.g. ethics approval for

sensitive data

g. Publicly accessible



#### 6. Is the data available online without requiring specialized protocols or tools once access has been approved?

a. No access to data

b. By individual arrangement

c. File download from online location

d. Non-standard web service (e.g. OpenAPI, Swagger, Informal API)

#### 7. Will the metadata record be available even if the data are no longer available?

a. Unsure

b. No

c. Yes


### **I**nteroperable


#### 8. What (file) formats is the data available in?

b. In a structured, open standard, non-machine-readable format

c. In a structured, open standard, machine-readable format



#### 9. What best describes the types of vocabularies/ontologies/tagging schemas used to define the data elements?

a. Data elements not described

b. No standards have been applied in the description of data elements

c. Standardised vocabularies/ontologies/schemas without global identifiers

d. Standardised, open and universal, using resolvable global identifiers linking to explanations



#### 10. How is the metadata linked to other data and metadata (to enhance context and clearly indicate relationships)?

a. There are no links to other metadata

b. The metadata record includes URI links to related metadata, data and definitions

c. Metadata is represented in machine-readable format, e.g. in a linked format such as

Resource Description Framework (RDF)
