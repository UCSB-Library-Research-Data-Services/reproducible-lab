Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. We can create a fork on Github by clicking the \"fork\" button in the top right corner of our repository webpage.\n![](img/github-fork.png) \n  \n  \nMost commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your work, you can initiate a ***Pull Request*** to initiate discussion about your modifications and requesting to integrate your changes to the main repository. Your commit history allows the original repository administrators to see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request. Do this by going to the original repository and clicking the \"New pull request\" button![](img/github-pull-request.png)  \n  \nNext, click \"compare across forks\", and use the dropdown menus to select your fork as the \"head fork\" and the original repository as the \"base fork\".![](img/github-compare-forks.png)  \n  \nThen type a title and description for the changes you would like to make. By using GitHub's `@mention` syntax in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams. \n\nThis workflow is recommended when you do not have push/write access to a repository, such as contributing to a open source software or R package, or if you are heavily changing a project.\n\n## Collaborating through write / push access\n\nWhen you collaborate closely and actively with colleagues, you do not want necessarily to have to review all their changes through pull requests. You can then give them write access (`git push`) to your repository to allow them to directly edit and contribute to its content. This is the workflow we will recommend to use within your working group.\n\n### Adding collaborators to a repository \n\n* Click on the repository\n* On the right panel, click ![](img/github-repo-settings.png)\n* On the left pane, click `Collaborators` and enter the usernames you want to add![collaborators](img/github-collaborators.png) \n\nUnder this collaborative workflow, we recommend to use git `branches` combined with pull requests to avoid conflicts and to track and discuss collaborators contributions.\n\n# Branches\n\n![source: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-merge](img/atlassian_branches_sketch.png)\n\nWhat are branches?  Well in fact nothing new, as the `master` is a branch. A branch represents an independent line of development, parallel to the master (branch). \n\nWhy should you use branches? For 2 main reasons:\n\n* We want the master to only keep a version of the code that is working\n* We want to version the code we are developing to add/test new features (for now we mostly talk about feature branch) in our script without altering the version on the master.\n\n## Working with branches\n\n### Creating a new branch\n\nIn RStudio, you can create a branch using the git tab. \n\n1. Click on the branch button\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/rstudio-git-branch-create.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n2. Fill the branch name in the new branch window; in this example, we are going to use `test` for the name; leave the other options as default and click create \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/rstudio-git-branch-test.png){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n3. you will be directly creating a local and remote branch and switch to it \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/rstudio-git-branch-new.png){fig-align='center' width=62%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCongratulations you just created your first branch! \n\nLet us check on Github:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/github-new-branch.png){fig-align='center' width=45%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, now there are two branches on our remote repository: \n- master\n- test\n\n### Using a branch\n\nHere there is nothing new. The workflow is exactly the same as we did before, excepts our commit will be created on the `test` branch instead of the master branch.\n",
