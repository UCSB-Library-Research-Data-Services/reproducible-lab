It also includes where to store and share your work in data / code repositories.\n\n## Documentation\n\nOnly a few people with free time ahead of them will sit wondering about what to do next and think \"what if I were to write some documentation!?\". Make it part of your workflow! and do not let it get out of sync too much as you iterate on your analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![https://twitter.com/JenMsft/status/1557218211971489792](img/found_documentationjpg.jpeg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Know your audience\n\nThere are actually various ways to document your work!! Here is a potential framework to help to think about those different types of documentation and their related audiences:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![ source:  https://diataxis.fr/](img/document_diataxis.png){width=150%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYour potential audience(s) for your documentation can be a future collaborator, an external researcher with no direct insight into your work, or a potential user of a tool you developed.\n\n\n## Prompts\n\n- What are the specific expectations from your discipline in terms of documentation and sharing data? For example, should you also share the raw data along with the analysis results?\n\n- Considering funding and publisher mandates, as well as disciplinary norms.  Do you anticipate / have had any challenges regarding data sharing and preservation?\n",
