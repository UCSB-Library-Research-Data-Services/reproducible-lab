## What are GitHub teams

You can use teams to manage access for people in an organization and for sending notifications (you can @team as you will do with @user in issues, commit messages and more). Teams are a great way to manage access to repositories. You can add specific people to different teams and then you can use those teams to provide similar access to repositories. If you are familiar with Google Groups and how they can be used to provide access to folders in Google drive, this is the same concept. 

Teams are very convenient when a set of collaborators work on the same project and therefore need the same access to different repositories within your organization. You can simply add the team to a specific repository and all the team members will be added to the repositories instead of having to add each user individually.
