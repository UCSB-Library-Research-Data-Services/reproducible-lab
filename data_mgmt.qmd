title: "Managing your lab data"

## Data are a scientific product

Data are also part of the scientific products your Lab is producing. It is thus important to develop strategies to manage them well, so you can reuse them. Well managed, data can become an an asset for your lab and your collaborators. In the end, the goal of managing your data is to develop documentation that will enable others (including your future self) to understand and reuse those data sets. This documentation does not start when you are wrapping up your project, this process needs to be intergrate all along the data life cycle of your project.


### Data Life Cycle

To help you think about your Lab data management, you can divide the life cycle of a data set in several phases:

### How are you feeling about your data?

Here are a few prompts to help you start your thinking about how you manage your data and where are potential challenges. These prompts should help you to decide where to start and we encourge to discuss them with the entire team:

- What are your lab challenges related to accessing, manipulating and/or moving data?
- What are your lab needs, pain points, or where do you feel time is wasted related to ensuring future use of data by yourself or others? 
- What are your main security or data loss concerns related to your data?
- What are your data that might contain sensitive information (geolocation, human subjects, ...) and thus need special handling?
- How have funder mandates for data or publication deposits created challenges for you?
