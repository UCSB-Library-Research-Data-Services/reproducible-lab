### How are you feeling about your data?

Here are a few prompts to help you start thinking about how you manage your data and where are potential challenges. These prompts should help you to decide where to start:

- What are your lab challenges related to accessing, manipulating and/or moving data?
- What are your lab needs, pain points, or where do you feel time is wasted related to ensuring future use of data by yourself or others? 
- What are your main security or data loss concerns related to your data?
- What are your data that might contain sensitive information (geolocation, human subjects, ...) and thus need special handling?
- How have funder mandates for data or publication deposits created challenges for you?
