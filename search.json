We don’t require that everyone take the driver role; it is everyone’s choice whether to do so\nWhole Team - every contributor to the project is an integral part of the whole team; when we don’t have the skills we need within the team, we find someone who does and invite them to work with us to accomplish the needed work\nReflect, Tune, and Adjust Frequently - based on agile principle: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”"

We have found that drivers learn better this way, and they don’t just end up feeling like a stenographer. Whenever possible, we ask questions that lead the driver to discover the answers on their own.\nStay focused and be present: Shut your laptop and put your phone away. I have struggled with following this guideline—we all have—and I recognize that the distraction almost always affects the rest of the mob. We tell all our mob members to be present, and if you can not, it is OK to leave until you can be.\nUse a timer, but be ready to pause it: We switch drivers every 20 - 60 minutes. However, we often wander off implementation into design discussions—it’s unavoidable—so this is when we pause the timer. This is another key guideline of our mob: the time you spend driving should be dedicated to writing the code that helps complete the task, not discussing design solutions.\nSet specific tasks for each session: When our mob gathers for a session, we first agree on and create a checklist of the tasks we are going to complete, and order them by priority on a whiteboard. This ensures we are all focused on the same task and keeps us moving forward. Additionally, this keeps us aligned with Minimal Marketable Feature (MMF) work, which we can communicate with our engineering and product managers to assure them we are completing tasks that align with developing small, self-contained features that demonstrate immediate customer value."

The template used to create this special README provide suggestions about the type of information you might want to add to your landing page. Those suggestions are in a comment block (delimited by &lt;!-- & --&gt;) and thus won’t be shown when the READEM is rendered. We still do recommend to delete this block once you are done editing your README\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is as example how we defined the landing page README for our test organization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your README: Now that you have your first version of your GitHub organization landing page (you can always iterate later on it), we are ready to save this version by clicking on the Commit changes button (red box above). This will prompt a new page where you can add a commit message to describe the changes. Finally you can hit the Commit changes button to save this version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoilà 🎉 !! When you go back to your organization main page, you should now see the text you just wrote at the top of the landing page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up your organization profile\nNow that you have a landing page, it is also a great idea to fill out some metadata about your organization under the Settings tab of the main navigation bar (top right). This will help with the discovery of your Organization. You can provide a more Human friendly name, an email to reach out to you, a short description of your organisation, and an URL such as your lab home page.\n\nFinally, click Update profile to save your changes."

Once you are done you can ask to send back and merge those changes to the current version of the main branch of the repository (for now we will only merge back to main)."

If you do not know their username you can search by their full names. Note that if there are no pictures associated to the profile you fund or are not sure it is the right person, we recommend to not add this person at this time and to reach out asking for their username (which is unique). If you are sure you found the right persons, you can click on Invite.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou collaborators will receive an invitation to join the team.
