The application process is straight forward. Get started here: https://education.github.com/\n\n\n\nYou can create an organization by clicking on the + sign menu at the top right of the GitHub task bar and select New organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will send you to a new page with several options to start your organization. Choose the free option at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can provide the name of your organization. We recommend to name it in a way that reflects your Lab name to help with the organization branding. Select the email you used to get the education discount and check the ‚Äúmy personal account‚Äù option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd congratulations this is it!! You can now invite your collaborators to the organization (you will be able to do so later as well).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour organization page should look as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote all the suggestions that GitHub is providing to help you customize your organization according to your need. We are going to follow the recommendation on the right side (red box) to add a special README.md that will act as a landing page for our organization."

It is also a good location to describe guidelines how to best engage with you and provide contact information.\n\nClick on the create a README file on the right side bar (see red box above). This will trigger the creation of a new special repository called .github tht will be used to host your README file. Click Create repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill out the necessary information as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend to check the box Add a README file as a good practice but note it is not the README that will be used as your landing page, it is the one describing this new repository hosting your landing page README in a special subfolder.\n\nCreate your landing page by clicking on the Add README button on the right side bar (red box below)\n\n Note the path to this special README: .github/profile/README.md\n\nEdit your landing page. The template used to create this special README provide suggestions about the type of information you might want to add to your landing page. Those suggestions are in a comment block (delimited by &lt;!-- & --&gt;) and thus won‚Äôt be shown when the READEM is rendered. We still do recommend to delete this block once you are done editing your README\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is as example how we defined the landing page README for our test organization:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your README: Now that you have your first version of your GitHub organization landing page (you can always iterate later on it), we are ready to save this version by clicking on the Commit changes button (red box above). This will prompt a new page where you can add a commit message to describe the changes. Finally you can hit the Commit changes button to save this version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoil√† üéâ !! When you go back to your organization main page, you should now see the text you just wrote at the top of the landing page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up your organization profile\nNow that you have a landing page, it is also a great idea to fill out some metadata about your organization under the Settings tab of the main navigation bar (top right). This will help with the discovery of your Organization. You can provide a more Human friendly name, an email to reach out to you, a short description of your organisation, and an URL such as your lab home page.\n\nFinally, click Update profile to save your changes."

If you are sure you found the right persons, you can click on Invite.\n\nYou collaborators will receive an invitation to join the team. They will have to accept the invitation before they can use the benefits (access to repositories, ‚Ä¶) associated with the team.
