    "section": "",
    "text": "In a nutshell, your goal is to organize your research lab in a way that will let you document and preserve your scientific products - including raw and derived data when possible. When delivering a project to a funder, it is important to ensure the funder can understand and reuse the products (code, data, apps) you have developed. For those reasons, more and more funders require a data management plan as part of their proposal submission process; therefore, it is a great skill to develop.\nHaving a plan to manage your data will save you from some potential painful hiccups and time as you progress through your project data life cycle. In other words, it is time well spent to develop your data management plan, and the earlier in your project, the better you have a good sense of how you will manage your data. The discussion with your project team about what should be included in the plan is as important as the plan itself since the questions you will have to answer will help you think more about your data (e.g., type, size, processing methods, etc.) and assign roles and responsibilities among project members.\nOnce your lab data are well managed, it becomes easier to archive and share relevant data in a publicly accessible data repository such as Dryad as your projects are completed or important milestones are achieved. For your work to generate a reproducible data archive, metadata and documentation must also be provided, as well as the scripts you have developed for your analysis. Here is a good example of a well-documented data archive: https://doi.org/10.25349/D9JK6N\nBefore writing your plan, we recommend you get familiar with the FAIR and CARE principles to guide your process.\nThose two principles should be the overarching guidelines that will guide the development of your data management plan.",

    "text": "Developing your Lab Data Management Plan (DMP)\nYou might already have experience with writing project specific data management plans as they are often required in proposals. The process to develop your lab’s data management plan is very similar, but will be more focused on developing general guidelines for your lab that can be adapted for project specific needs. We recommend using the FAIR & CARE principles as guidance to maximize the reusability of your data by you, your collaborators, other researchers, and futureself. Your plan should ensure that detailed documentation adopting existing standards is developed during the entire duration of your project (don’t wait until the very end!!) and that this documentation is archived along with your data and code in a publicly accessible data repository will set you up for success.\n\n\n\nsource: https://www.library.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/dls-n04-2021-fair-navy.pdf\n\n\nBelow is a set of questions that will help your team to develop your guidelines about the data and resources you will need along projects’ data lifecycle in your research lab.\n\nDescribing the research data generated by your lab: Provide a description of the data the group will collect or re-use, including the file types, data set size, the number of expected files or sets, content, and source of the data (creator and method of collection).\n\nWhat data are needed?\nAre such data available?\nWhen and how will the data be acquired?\n\nData formats:\n\nAre there any standard formats in the specific research field for managing or disseminating the data sets that have been identified (e.g., XML, ASCII, CSV, .shp, .gdb, GeoTIFF)?\nWho from the group will have responsibility for ensuring that data standards are properly applied, and data are properly formatted?\n\nMetadata: Metadata is documentation that helps make data sets reusable. Think about what details someone would need in order to be able to understand and use these files. For example, perhaps a readme.txt file is necessary to explain variables, the structure of the files, etc. In addition, it is recommended to leverage metadata disciplinary standards, including ontologies and vocabularies. Here is a good resource for metadata standards in environmental sciences. When applicable, also describe other scientific products - models, scripts, and/or workflows - your group will be producing using README files and documenting your code.\nIntellectual property and re-use: If data were collected from the client organization, does the group have the right to redistribute it? If so, are there any restrictions on redistribution? If the group created its data files, would it assign a Creative Commons license to its data?\nData sharing and preservation: The data may have significant value to other researchers beyond this project, and sharing this data can be a valuable contribution to your field. Specify the extent to which data can be reused, including any access limitations. List any proprietary software that might be needed to read the files. If some data is not shareable due to confidentiality, non-disclosure agreements (NDA), or disclosure risk, state such limitations and the rationale behind them. Note that not being allow to share your data does not mean you can not document!! Not all data needs to be saved. Here are some questions to ask yourselves:\n\nIf another researcher wanted to replicate the group’s work or re-use the group’s data, what data and documentation would be required for them to do so?\n\nWhere will the data and metadata be stored after the project is completed?\nIs there a subject-specific and/or open-access repository that is appropriate for the data?\n\n\nOne advantage to depositing your data in a data repository is that you can get a DOI that lets you easily share and cite your data. Most of the data repositories also track views, downloads, and citations for your data archive, which can be used as a metric or a proxy for research impact.",

Very descriptive names.\nYou can think of the public key as a padlock, and only you have the key (the private key) to open it. You use the public key where you want a secure method of communication, such as your GitHub account. You give this padlock, or public key, to GitHub and say “lock the communications to my account with this so that only computers that have my private key can unlock communications and send git commands as my GitHub account.”\n\n\nThe first thing we are going to do is check if this has already been done on the computer you’re on. Because generally speaking, this setup only needs to happen once and then you can forget about it:\nls -al ~/.ssh\nYour output is going to look a little different depending on whether or not SSH has ever been set up on the computer you are using.\n\n\nIf SSH has been set up on the computer you’re using, the public and private key pairs will be listed. The file names are either id_ed25519/id_ed25519.pub or id_rsa/id_rsa.pub depending on how the key pairs were set up.\n\n\n\nls: cannot access '/Users/brunj7/.ssh': No such file or directory\nCreate an SSH key pair\nTo create an SSH key pair Vlad uses this command, where the -t option specifies which type of algorithm to use and -C attaches a comment to the key (here, Vlad’s email):\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"youremail@provider.org\"\nIf you are using a legacy system that doesn’t support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\nGenerating public/private ed25519 key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/brunj7/.ssh/id_ed25519):\nWe want to use the default file, so just press Enter.\nCreated directory '/Users/brunj7/.ssh'.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nNow, it is prompting you for a passphrase. Be sure to use something memorable or save your passphrase somewhere, as there is no “reset my password” option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen you enter password at the shell, the keystrokes do not produce the usual “dot” showing you that you are typing, but your keystrokes are being registered… so keep typing you password !!\n\n\nEnter same passphrase again:\nAfter entering the same passphrase a second time, we receive the confirmation\nYour identification has been saved in /Users/brunj7/.ssh/id_ed25519\nYour public key has been saved in /Users/brunj7/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\nThe key fingerprint is:\nSHA256:SMSPIStNyA00KPxuYu94KpZgRAYjgt9g4BA4kFy3g1o vlad@tran.sylvan.ia\nThe key's randomart image is:\n+--[ED25519 256]--+\n|^B== o.          |\n|%*=.*.+          |\n|+=.E =.+         |\n| .=.+.o..        |\n|....  .

The public key is appropriately named. The “key fingerprint” is a shorter version of a public key.\nNow that we have generated the SSH keys, we will find the SSH files when we check.\nls -al ~/.ssh\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 brunj7  staff 197121  Oct 23  13:14 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 brunj7  staff 197121  Mar 11  09:21 ../\n-rw------- 1 brunj7  staff    464  Apr 21  2023 id_ed25519\n-rw-r--r-- 1 brunj7  staff    103  Apr 21  2023 id_ed25519.pub",

    "text": "Tracking your work\nLet’s create a text file called index.md and add it to our repository. The file will later be converted into a webpage by GitHub pages. We’ll write the file using a syntax called Markdown, which is why we use the .md extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe’ll use nano to edit the file; you can use whatever editor you like. In particular, this does not have to be the core.editor you set globally earlier. But remember, the bash command to create or edit a new file will depend on the editor you choose (it might not be nano). For a refresher on text editors, check out “Which Editor?” in The Unix Shell lesson.\n\n\nnano index.md\nType the text below, replacing the names with people you know:\n## Listing of my favorite desserts\n\n- Julien, crepes\n\nExit nano and save your changes.\nCheck it worked:\n$ cat index.md\nYou should see the content you just typed!\nIf we check the status of our project again, Git tells us that it’s noticed the new file:\n$ git status\nOn branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n   (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    index.md\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nThe “untracked files” message means that there’s a file in the directory that Git isn’t keeping track of. We can tell Git to track a file using git add:\n$ git add index.md\nand then check that the right thing happened:\n$ git status\nOn branch main\n\nNo commits yet\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n\n    new file:   index.md\n\nGit now knows that it’s supposed to keep track of index.md, but it hasn’t recorded these changes as a commit yet. To get it to do that, we need to run one more command:\n$ git commit -m \"start new webpage\"\n[main (root-commit) f22b25e] Start new webpage\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 index.md\nWhen we run git commit, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using git add and stores a copy permanently inside the special .git directory. This permanent copy is called a commit (revision) and its short identifier is f22b25e. Your commit may have another identifier.\nWe use the -m flag (for “message”) to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why. If we just run git commit without the -m option, Git will launch nano (or whatever other editor we configured as core.editor) so that we can write a longer message.\nGood commit messages start with a brief (&lt;50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence “If applied, this commit will” . If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.\nIf we run git status now:\n$ git status\nOn branch main\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nit tells us everything is up to date. If we want to know what we’ve done recently, we can ask Git to show us the project’s history using git log:\n$ git log\ncommit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b\nAuthor: ...\nDate:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400\n\n    start new webpage\ngit log lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order. The listing for each commit includes the commit’s full identifier (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the git commit command earlier), the commit’s author, when it was created, and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Are My Changes?\n\n\n\nIf we run ls at this point, we will still see just one file called index.md. That’s because Git saves information about files’ history in the special .git directory mentioned earlier so that our filesystem doesn’t become cluttered (and so that we can’t accidentally edit or delete an old version).\n\n\nLet’s adds more information to the file. (Again, we’ll edit with nano and then cat the file to show its contents; you may use a different editor, and don’t need to cat.)\n$ nano index.md\n## Listing of my favorite desserts\n\n- Julien, crepes\n- Sophia, chocolate\n\nWhen we run git status now, it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:\n$ git status\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   index.md\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nThe last line is the key phrase: “no changes added to commit”.\nWe have changed this file, but we haven’t told Git we will want to save those changes (which we do with git add) nor have we saved them (which we do with git commit). So let’s do that now. It is good practice to always review our changes before saving them. We do this using git diff.\nThis shows us the differences between the current state of the file and the most recently saved version:\n$ git diff\ndiff --git a/index.md b/index.md\nindex 7d781a7..bbb33fe 100644\n--- a/index.md\n+++ b/index.md\n@@ -1 +1,3 @@\n## Listing of my favorite desserts\n\n- Julien, crepes\n+ - Sophia, chocolate\n\nThe output is cryptic because it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and patch telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other. If we break it down into pieces:\n\nThe first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix diff command comparing the old and new versions of the file.\nThe second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing; 7d781a7 and bbb33fe are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.\nThe third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.\nThe remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences and the lines on which they occur. In particular, the + marker in the first column shows where we added a line.\n\nAfter reviewing our change, it’s time to commit it:\n$ git commit -m \"add Sophia\"\nOn branch main\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   index.md\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nWhoops: Git won’t commit because we didn’t use git add first. Let’s fix that:\n$ git add index.md\n$ git commit -m \"add Sophia\"\n[main 019f377] add Sophia\n 1 file changed, 1 insertions(+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit insists that we add files to the set we want to commit before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than only large batches. For example, suppose we’re adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis. We might want to commit those additions, and the corresponding bibliography entries, but not commit some of our work drafting the conclusion (which we haven’t finished yet).\nTo allow for this, Git has a special staging area where it keeps track of things that have been added to the current changeset but not yet committed.",

When this “pager” is called, you will notice that the last line in your screen is a :, instead of your usual prompt.\n\nTo get out of the pager, press Q.\nTo move to the next page, press Spacebar.\nTo search for some_word in all pages, press / and type some_word. Navigate through matches pressing N.\n\nTo avoid having git log cover your entire terminal screen, you can limit the number of commits that Git lists by using -N, where N is the number of commits that you want to view. For example, if you only want information from the last commit you can use:\n$ git log -1\ncommit d11d7e52ab98d3d4c18cde4c4a0bbeea3fe40983 (HEAD -&gt; main)\nAuthor: ...\nDate:   Thu Oct 19 12:07:51 2023 -0400\n\n    add Sophia\nYou can also reduce the quantity of information using the --oneline option:\n$ git log --oneline\nd11d7e5 (HEAD -&gt; main) add Sophia\n019f377 start new webpage\n8defaab initial commit\nYou can also combine the --oneline option with others.

It also lists the GitHub Organizations you are part of. But more importantly, Users own repositories to host and share their code. You can list repositories from a User by clicking on the repositories tab in the main GitHub menu bar at the top.\n\n\n\n\nWe will talk more about GitHub Organizations later. In a nutshell, organizations are like groups or teams that users can be members of. Like Users, Organizations can have a landing page and own repositories. However, they add several perks in terms of user management. Similarly to Users, you can access repositories from an Organization by clicking on the repositories tab in the main GitHub menu bar at the top. You can access an organization’s page similarly to a user: https://github.com/organization-name; e.g. https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis screen shows the copy of a repository stored on GitHub, with its list of files, when the files and directories were last modified, and some information on who made the most recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we drill into the “commits” for the repository, we can see the history of changes made to all of the files.

Once logged in, you can access your dashboard at https://github.com\n\n\n\n\nThis page can be reached using with the following URL: https://github.com/username. For my user (brunj7) it would be: https://github.com/brunj7. It is a great space for you to provide some information about yourself and the main repositories you are working on. It also lists the GitHub Organizations you are part of. But more importantly, Users own repositories to host and share their code. You can list repositories from a User by clicking on the repositories tab in the main GitHub menu bar at the top.\n\n\n\n\nWe will talk more about GitHub Organizations later. In a nutshell, organizations are like groups or teams that users can be members of. Like Users, Organizations can have a landing page and own repositories. However, they add several perks in terms of user management. Similarly to Users, you can access repositories from an Organization by clicking on the repositories tab in the main GitHub menu bar at the top. You can access an organization’s page similarly to a user: https://github.com/organization-name; e.g. https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis screen shows the copy of a repository stored on GitHub, with its list of files, when the files and directories were last modified, and some information on who made the most recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we drill into the “commits” for the repository, we can see the history of changes made to all of the files. Looks like kellijohnson and seananderson were fixing things in June and July:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, if we drill into the changes made on June 13, we can see exactly what was changed in each file:\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking these changes, and seeing how they relate to released versions of software and files is exactly what Git and GitHub are good for. We will show how they can really be effective for tracking versions of scientific code, figures, and manuscripts to accomplish a reproducible workflow.",

    "text": "What scientific products to preserve?\nOften the first question that comes to mind when starting to preserve your work is: What should I include in my data archive? Generally speaking, you want to preserve your work. This means capturing the methodology you used, the raw data you collected, any data cleaning you did, and any data and output (figure, report, etc.) you generated. Okay… so you mean everything!? Well, yes and no. Everything relevant to help you come to the findings and conclusions discussed in your project report or any other publications and deliverables. Let’s break this down!\n\nRaw data\nHere are a few questions to ask yourself to determine if you should refer in your documentation to the raw data you used or also include them in your data archive.\n\nThe raw data is already publicly accessible, and the hosting solution (website, FTP server, etc.) seems well maintained (ideally providing a recommended citation)\n\n=&gt; Document the website or process you used to collect the data and when you accessed/downloaded the data you used. Try also to determine if a specific version number is associated with the data you used.*\n\nThe raw data is not publicly accessible\n\nNote that we are not talking about data under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) here but more about data with an unclear reuse status or obtained by interactions with a person or an institution. For example, if the data you used were sent to you privately, then we recommend that you:\n\ninquire with your person of contact about the status of licensing and if they would be willing to let you share those data publicly. You might face resistance at first, so take the time to explain why you think it is valuable to your work to also share those data sets.\nif, in the end, it is not possible to share the data, please still describe the data in your documentation and list the contact information (person or institution) to inquire about this data set.\n\n\n\nIntermediate data\nThis is data you generated either while cleaning or analyzing the raw data. You should preserve it if:\n\nit was not directly generated by a script (otherwise, preserve the code instead)\nit has reusable value. For example, cleaned-up versions of raw data can be very valuable for others to reuse!\n\n\n\nCode\nScripting your analytical workflow from the raw data to the end products is a great way to make your work more reproducible and more reusable by others. We thus strongly encourage your team to develop code to process and analyze data. Cloud-based code repository services, such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and more, are a great way to both manage and preserve your code.\nThose services are often well-integrated with data repositories that link your code repository with your data archive. They also offer a way to tag a specific version of your code to ensure it is the exact code you used for a specific analysis.\n\n\nFinal products\nWe recommend including any data set used to produce statistics, figures maps, and other visualizations that were used in your work, in this case, even if generated by scripts.",

The icon describes the change:\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom R packages, H. Wickham\n\n\n\n\nIn our case, it means that:\n\nthe .gitignorefile has been modified since the last commit\nthe .Rproj file has never been tracked by git (remember RStudio just created this project file for us)\n\nNote also that the README.md file is not listed, but it exists (see Filespane). It is because files with no modifications since the last commit are not listed.\nGitHub has created the .gitignore file for us and we have not modified it since. So why is it listed as modified? We can check this by clicking on the Diff button (upper-left on the Git pane).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that a new line (in green) has been added at the end of the .gitignore file. In fact, RStudio did that when creating the project to make sure that some temporary files were not tracked by git.\nLet us improve the content of the README.md file as below to make it more descriptive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as you save your changes, you should see the README.md file listed as modified in the git pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us look at the diff of the README.md file. As you can see, the original lines are in red, in other words for git those lines have been deleted. The new lines that we just typed are in green, which indicates that these lines have been added for git. Note the line numbers in the left margin that help you to track which lines have been removed and added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping Changes as Snapshots\nNow we would like to save a snapshot of this version of the README.md file. Here are the steps we will need to do:\n\nAdd the file to the next commit by checking the box in front of the file name in the git pane.\nNote that the icon M will move to the left to show you that this file is now staged to be part of the next commit\nCommit:\n\nClick the Commit button at the top of the git pane\nWrite a short but descriptive commit message in the new window\nClick on the the Commit button to save this version of the file in the git database\nClose the windows to get back to the main RStudio window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, add both the .gitignore and the myfirst-repo.Rproj and commit those files together.\n Note that the icons at the top of the git pane have been organized in sequence from left to right to match the git workflow.\n\n\nGood Commit Message Tips\nClearly, good documentation of what you’ve done is critical to making the version history of your repository meaningful and helpful. It is tempting to skip the commit message altogether, or to add some simple message like ‘Updates’. It is better to use messages that will be helpful to your future self in deducing not just what you did, but why you did it. Also, commit messages are best understood if they follow the active verb convention. For example, you can see that my commit messages all started with a past tense verb, and then explained what was changed.\nWhile some of the changes we illustrated here were simple and easily explained in a short phrase, for more complex changes, it is best to provide a more complete message. The convention, however, is to always have a short, terse first sentence, followed by a more verbose explanation of the details and rationale for the change. This keeps the high level details readable in the version log. I can not count the number of times I have looked at the commit log from 2, 3, or 10 years prior and been so grateful for the diligence of my past self and collaborators.\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom xkcd comics",

    "text": "Sending changes back to GitHub\nNow that we have created these two commits on our local machine, our local version of the repository is different from the version on GitHub. RStudio communicate this information to you. If you look below the icons on the git pane, you will see the warning message: “Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/master’ by two commits”. This can be translated as you have two additional commits on your local machine that you never shared back to the remote repository on GitHub. Open your favorite web browser and look at the content of your repository on GitHub. You will see the old version of the README.md and .gitignore file and no trace of the .Rproj file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two git commands to exchange between local and remote versions of a repository:\n\npull: git will get the latest remote version and try to merge it with your local version\npush: git will send your local version to the remote version of the repository (in our case GitHub)\n\nBefore sending your local version to the remote, you should always get the latest remote version first. In other words, you should pull first and push second. This is the way git protects the remote version against incompatibilities with the local version. You always deal with potential problems on your local machine. Therefore your sequence will always be:\n\npull\npush\n\nRStudio has icons for that on top of the git pane, with the blue arrow down being for pull and the green arrow up being for push. Remember the icons are organized in sequence!\nLet us do the pull and push to synchronize the remote repositories. We have now synchronized the local (our computer) and remote (on GitHub) versions of our repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now look at the page of your repository on GitHub, you should see 3 files with the exact same version that you have on your local!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage versus Commit\n\n\n\nThe functional difference between “staging” a file and “committing” one can be a little tough to grasp at first so let’s explore that briefly here. We can make an analogy with taking a family picture, where each family member would represent a file.\n\nStaging files is like deciding which family member(s) are going to be in your next picture\nCommitting is like taking the picture\n\nThis 2-step process enables you to flexibly group files into a specific commit. Those groupings can be helpful to you later if you’re trying to find what you changed for a specific task (because those changes likely are all in the same commit).",

The application process is straightforward. Get started here: https://education.github.com/\n\n\n\nYou can create an organization by clicking on the + sign menu at the top right of the GitHub taskbar and select New organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will send you to a new page with several options to start your organization. Choose the free option at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can provide the name of your organization. We recommend naming it in a way that reflects your Lab name to help with the organization’s branding. Select the email you used to get the education discount and check the “my personal account” option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd congratulations this is it!! You can now invite your collaborators to the organization (you will be able to do so later as well).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour organization page should look as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote all the suggestions that GitHub is providing to help you customize your organization according to your needs.

Click Create repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill out the necessary information as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend checking the box Add a README file as a good practice but note it is not the README that will be used as your landing page, it is the one describing this new repository hosting your landing page README in a special subfolder.\n\nCreate your landing page by clicking on the Add README button on the right sidebar (red box below)\n\n Note the path to this special README: .github/profile/README.md\n\nEdit your landing page. The template used to create this special README provides suggestions about the type of information you might want to add to your landing page. Those suggestions are in a comment block (delimited by &lt;!-- & --&gt;) and thus won’t be shown when the README is rendered.

This will prompt a new page where you can add a commit message to describe the changes. Finally, you can hit the Commit changes button to save this version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoilà 🎉 !! When you go back to your organization’s main page, you should now see the text you just wrote at the top of the landing page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up your organization profile\nNow that you have a landing page, it is also a great idea to fill out some metadata about your organization under the Settings tab of the main navigation bar (top right). This will help with the discovery of your Organization. You can provide a more Human friendly name, an email to reach out to you, a short description of your organization, and an URL such as your lab home page.\n\nFinally, click Update profile to save your changes.",

We have found that drivers learn better this way, and they don’t just end up feeling like a stenographer. Whenever possible, we ask questions that lead the driver to discover the answers on their own.\nStay focused and be present: Shut your laptop and put your phone away. I have struggled with following this guideline—we all have—and I recognize that the distraction almost always affects the rest of the mob. We tell all our mob members to be present, and if you can not, it is OK to leave until you can be.\nUse a timer, but be ready to pause it: We switch drivers every 20 - 60 minutes. However, we often wander off implementation into design discussions—it’s unavoidable—so this is when we pause the timer. This is another key guideline of our mob: the time you spend driving should be dedicated to writing the code that helps complete the task, not discussing design solutions.\nSet specific tasks for each session: When our mob gathers for a session, we first agree on and create a checklist of the tasks we are going to complete and order them by priority on a whiteboard. This ensures we are all focused on the same task and keeps us moving forward. Additionally, this keeps us aligned with Minimal Marketable Feature (MMF) work, which we can communicate with our engineering and product managers to assure them we are completing tasks that align with developing small, self-contained features that demonstrate immediate customer value.",
