The “Designing a Reproducible and Collaborative Research Lab” program, currently piloted by the Research & Data Services (RDS) department at the [UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/), combines group workshops, own-pace learning, and personalized coaching sessions for Faculty and their Team son the following topics.

### Topics

-   Coding as a lab
-   Managing your lab data
-   Automating your analytical workflows
-   Documenting & preserving things to make them reusable

### Format

-   Scheduled at your convenience
-   4 workshops (2-3h) as a primer on a specific topic
-   Personalized coaching sessions focused on lab-specific needs

### Outcomes

-   More reproducible management of your lab's scientific products (data, code etc.)
-   Better analytical strategies for collaboration safety nets for your research lab content
-   More efficient reuse of your work
-   Streamlined on- and off -boarding of collaborators

### Learning Opportunities

-   Leverage GitHub to manage and collaborate on your Lab’s code
-   Develop strategies to centralize and manage your Lab’s data
-   Set up templates and guidelines on how to document your Lab research and improve its reusability
-   Establish Lab operating procedures and documentation standards
-   Protect your Lab’s scientific products against loss through backup and computing resources strategies
