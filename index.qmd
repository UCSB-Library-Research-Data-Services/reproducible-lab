The **Designing a Reproducible and Collaborative Lab (RCL) Program**,  currently piloted by the Research & Data Services (RDS) department at the [UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/), combines group workshops, self-paced learning, and personalized coaching sessions for Faculty and their Team(s) on the following topics:

### Topics

- Managing your lab data more efficiently
- Collaborative coding as a lab
- Automating your analytical workflows from raw data to scientific outputs
- Documenting & preserving things to make them reusable


### Format

- Scheduled at your convenience
- 4 whole lab workshops as a primer on a specific topic
- Personalized coaching sessions focused on lab-specific needs

### Lab Outcomes

- More reproducible management of your lab’s scientific products (data, code, and more!)
- Better analytical strategies for collaboration 
- Safety nets for your research lab content
- More efficient reuse of your work
- Streamlined on- and off- boarding of collaborators


### Learning Opportunities for Lab Members

- Leverage GitHub to manage and collaborate on your lab’s code
- Develop strategies to centralize and manage your lab data
- Protect your lab’s scientific products against loss through backup and computing resources strategies
- Develop guidelines and templates on how to document your Lab research products and improve their reusability
- Adopt "good enough" research computing strategies for robust and more reusable code development & data management

### Testimony

"Participating in this program has been absolutely invaluable for my team. We all learned so much, from using GitHub for lab coding projects to best practices for naming files, to how to create an ‘asset library’ for all of the video data we collect that will be future-proof and useful for numerous unforeseen projects into the future."

_-- Dr.Eleanor Caves, former participant_
