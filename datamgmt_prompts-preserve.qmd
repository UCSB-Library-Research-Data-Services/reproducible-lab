Only a few people with free time ahead of them will sit wondering about what to do next and think "what if I were to write some documentation!?". Make it part of your workflow, and do not let it get out of sync too much as your iterate on your analysis.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="https://twitter.com/JenMsft/status/1557218211971489792"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/found_documentationjpg.jpeg")
```

### Know your audience

There are actually various ways to document your work!! Here is a potential framework to help to think about those different types of documentation and their related audiences:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="150%",fig.cap=" source:  https://diataxis.fr/"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/document_diataxis.png")
```

Your potential audience(s) for your documentation can be a future collaborator, an external researcher with no direct insight on your work, a potential user of a tool you developed?


## Prompts

- What are the specific expectations from your discipline in terms of sharing data? Should you also share the raw data along with the analysis results?

- Considering funding and publisher mandates, as well as disciplinary norms, do you anticipate / have had any challenges regarding data sharing and preservation?
