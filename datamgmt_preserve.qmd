title: "Preserve your data for reuse"
---


As you finalize your projects, often an important task is to archive your data in a publicly available repository (pending sensitivity and by non-disclosure agreement exceptions). There are a few important steps to ensure that your data can be reused by others and thus make your work more reproducible.


## What scientific products to preserve?

Often the first question that comes to mind when starting to preserve your work is: What should I include in my data archive?  Generally speaking, you want to preserve **your** work. This means capturing the methodology you used, the raw data you collected, any data cleaning you did, and any data and output (figure, report, etc.) you generated. Okay… so you mean everything!? Well, yes and no. Everything that was relevant to help you to come to the findings and conclusions discussed in your project report or any other publications and deliverables. Let’s break this down!

### Raw data

Here are a few questions to ask yourself to determine if you should refer in your documentation to the raw data you used or also include them in your data archive.

1. The **raw data is already publicly accessible**, and the hosting solution (website, FTP server, etc.) seems well maintained (ideally providing a recommended citation) 

=> Document the website or process you used to collect the data and when you accessed/downloaded the data you used. Try also to determine if a pecific version number is associated with the data you used.*

2. The raw data is **not** publicly accessible

Note that we are not talking about data under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) here but more about data with an unclear reuse status or obtained by interactions with a person or an institution. For example, if the data you used were sent to you privately, then we recommend that you:

-  inquire with your person of contact about the status of licensing and if they would be willing to let you share those data publicly. You might face resistance at first, so take the time to explain why you think it is valuable to your work to also share those data sets.
-  if, in the end, it is not possible to share the data, please still describe the data in your documentation and list the contact information (person or institution) to inquire about this data set.  


### Intermediate data

This is data you generated either while cleaning or analyzing the raw data. You should preserve it if:

- it was not directly generated by a script (otherwise, preserve the code instead)
- it has reusable value. For example, cleaned-up versions of raw data can be very valuable for others to reuse!

###  Code

Scripting your analytical workflow from the raw data to the end products is a great way to make your work more reproducible and more reusable by others. We thus strongly encourage your team to develop code to process and analyze data. Cloud-based code repository services, such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and more, are a great way to both manage and preserve your code.

Those services are often well-integrated with data repositories that link your code repository with your data archive. They also offer a way to tag a specific version of your code to ensure it is the exact code you used for a specific analysis.

### Final products

We recommend including any data set used to produce statistics, figures maps, and other visualizations that were used in your work, in this case, even if generated by scripts.


## Choosing a data repository

We know what we want to archive, now we need to decide where we want to preserve things!

UCSB's institutional data repository [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) will be your default data repository. However, we encourage you to discuss with your Faculty Advisor to determine if other data repositories might suit your targeted audience/community better. 

If you would like to research on your own which data repository could be best for your project, the [Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org) is a great resource to do so.

### Dryad

[Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) is free of use for any affiliated researcher. Here is an overview of the process of submitting data to DRYAD:
